# Extra analyses
We ran our classifiers for different "intervention need" thresholds in order to investigate whether the biases exist no matter the threshold chosen.

## Tuglet
Tuglet students had post-test scores ranging from 0 to 10 in increments of 1. In the paper, every students who achieved a score strictly smaller than 9 were considered as "needing an intervention". 
For the extra analyses, we show what the performances would be if students in need of intervention were these with a score strictly smaller than 1, 3, 5, 7

## Beer's Law
Beer's Law students had a score ranging from understanding 0 variables to 3 variables in increment of 1. In the paper, every student who understood 2 or 3 vvariables were considered as being able to apply inquiry skills consistantly enough to reproduce it across multiple variables. We tested what it would look like if that threshold to not need intervention was above 1 or 3 (the original threhsold being 2).
